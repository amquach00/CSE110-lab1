## - About me -
## Hi, I'm a third year Computer Science major. I enjoy interacting with new people and ideas, and always looking to improve my software engineering skills. Also, I'm open to explore new opportunites in diverse fields. In my free time, I enjoy painting, dancing, listening to music, hanging out with friends, etc.

For more information about me, you can visit my [website](https://amquach00.github.io/portfolio/) that's still a work in progress.
